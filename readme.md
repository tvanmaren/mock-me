## Purpose

The purpose of project mockMe is to allow the user to create a mock-up presentation from silly ipsum data, stock photographs, and stock music. Ipsum data is sent to IBM watson for personality analysis, and that personality analysis is used to determine the appropriate images and accompanying music. The finished product is an uncannily fitting combination of meaningless text, photography, and music.

## Technology

The technology I use is a combination of HTML, Javascript, and JQuery, with styling and carousel functionality from Bootstrap, popcorn.js for audio integration, and ResponsiveVoice.JS for text-to-speech functionality.

## API integration

The API's I use are IBM Watson, Shutterstock Photos, Shutterstock Music, Hipster Ipsum, Dino Ipsum, Skate Ipsum, Pony Ipsum, and Bacon Ipsum. The app still grabs appropriate videos from Shutterstock Videos, but they never really fit into the presentation well enough to display them.
